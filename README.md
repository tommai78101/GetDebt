### Abstract

A game made in Unreal Engine 4. Project code only.

===

### Description

This is a project game made by me and my partner, Robert. It was made as an assignment on Technical Game Development using Unreal Engine 4.6. Over the duration of the course, the project was incrementally upgraded to 4.7, and now it's 4.7.6. 

The game's premise is to capture all of the students running away from you, before the time runs out.

===

### Story

Students at WPI have finished their MQPs in Robotics major, and are now getting ready to graduate. Unfortunately, the moment a student graduates, they will be hit with student loans. You, as a debt machine, are here to knock the sense out of the students and to remind them of paying back their student loans. A few students, who did their MQP in Robotics made a robot dog, decided to use the dogs to protect them from your claws. It is up to you to catch them, before the end of the graduation day.
